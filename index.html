        <p><h4>About me:</h4></p>
        	   I am a girl who is discovering more about code. I will be in the 11th grade this upcoming fall.
            I like exploring new activities and learning more about myself in the process. I like to go out with family
            and friends, especially to theme parks with all the fun rides.

        <p><h4>Likes:</h4></p>
            I love action or comedy movies, being outdoors and science fiction books. I like to make lanyards and bracelets, too.

        <p><h4>Dislikes:</h4></p>
            I really don't like onions or exotic food.
